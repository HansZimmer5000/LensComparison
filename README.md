# NikonLensComparison

## Overview
This project is about comparing all Nikon F Lenses, ever.
With all necessary data without the price.

### Attributes of each Lens
Each Entry should have (optional Data in extra brackets e.g. " (Af/VR/DX/Macro/...)"):

Entry                 Description of data
1. Full Name          Brand + Focal Length + Apeture + (Af/VR/DX/Macro/...), e.g. "Nikon 8-15mm 1:3.5-4.5E ED AF-S VR"
2. Focal Length Start millimeter
3. Focal Length End   millimeter
4. Apeture Start      e.g. 2,8
5. Apeture End        e.g. 4
6. Magnification      e.g. 0.11x
7. Filtersize         millimeter
8. AF                 AF, AF-S, MF?
9. VR                 VR? + (Generation)
10. FX/DX             DX or FX Lens?
11. Weight            gramm
12. Size              Width x Length

## Task List
- [ ] \(Must-Have)    Create UML graphs and keep them updated
- [ ] \(Must-Have)    Complete README file
- [ ] \(Must-Have)    Got all necessary data from the most Nikon F compatible lenses
- [ ] \(Must-Have)    Made a nice GUI for filtering and comparing the lenses (perhaps something like on "geizhals.de") 
- [ ] \(Should-Have)  Got all necessary data from all the Nikon F compatible lenses
- [ ] \(NiceTo-Have)  Move from Excel to a real database (e.g. Wide-Column?)
- [ ] \(NiceTo-Have)  Complete standalone program.

## Motivation
I really enjoy comparing all the lenses out there.
But on "geizhals.de" you just can compare all lenses which are in stock at the moment.
So all of the good old glas and perhaps one or the other pearl is missing in that list.
I didn't find such a list, so here I will build my own. 

Also I want to practice how to document a project well so everybody could understand it.
