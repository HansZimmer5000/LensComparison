# NikonLensComparison

## Overview
This project is about comparing all Nikon F Lenses, ever.
With all necessary data without the price.

### Attributes of each Lens
Each Entry should have (optional Data in extra brackets e.g. " (Af/VR/DX/Macro/...)"):

Entry                 Description of data
1. Full Lens Name-----Brand + Focal Length + Apeture + (Af/VR/DX/Macro/...), e.g. "Nikon 8-15mm 1:3.5-4.5E ED AF-S VR"
2. Focal Length Start--Millimeter
3. Focal Length End---Millimeter
4. Apeture Start-------e.g. 2,8
5. Apeture End--------e.g. 4
6. Filtersize------------Millimeter
7. Magnification------e.g. 0.11x or 0,11 or 1:4
8. Mount--------------e.g. Nikon F
9. Sensor--------------e.g. Full-Frame / Crop
10. Weight--------------Gramm
11. Size-----------------Diagramm x Length 



## Task List
- [ ] \(Must-Have)----(Never done) Create UML graphs and keep them updated
- [ ] \(Must-Have)----Complete README file
- [x] \(Must-Have)----Got all necessary data from the most Nikon F compatible lenses
- [x] \(Must-Have)----Made a nice GUI for filtering and comparing the lenses (perhaps something like on "geizhals.de") 
- [ ] \(Should-Have)--Got all necessary data from all the Nikon F compatible lenses
- [ ] \(Should-Have)--Data of Autofocus (AF,AF-S,MF) and Vibration Reduction
- [ ] \(Should-Have)--A Sheet with a Table where you can compare (from the ResultTable) selected lenses.
- [ ] \(NiceTo-Have)--Move from Excel to a real database (e.g. Wide-Column?)
- [ ] \(NiceTo-Have)--Complete standalone program.
- [ ] \(NiceTo-Have)--Not only Nikon F lenses, but all Lenses compatible to Nikon F (e.g. with adapter the Pentax Lenses)
- [ ] \(NiceTo-Have)--Sheet with a Table with alle the lenses someone ownes, to see how much you can do with them and if you really need a new lens.
- [ ] \(NiceTo-Have)--Not only Nikon F Lenses and Nikon F compatible lenses, but all Lenses every made.

## Motivation
I really enjoy comparing all the lenses out there.
But on "geizhals.de" you just can compare all lenses which are in stock at the moment.
So all of the good old glas and perhaps one or the other pearl is missing in that list.
I didn't find such a list, so here I will build my own. 

Also I want to practice how to document a project well so everybody could understand it.

###### Example Readme:
Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

Contributors
Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
