# NikonLensComparison

## Overview
This project is about comparing all Nikon F Lenses, ever.
With all necessary data without the price.

### Attributes of each Lens
Each Entry should have (optional Data in extra brackets e.g. " (Af/VR/DX/Macro/...)"):

Entry                 Description of data
1. Full Lens Name     Brand + Focal Length + Apeture + (Af/VR/DX/Macro/...), e.g. "Nikon 8-15mm 1:3.5-4.5E ED AF-S VR"
2. Focal Length Start Millimeter
3. Focal Length End   Millimeter
4. Apeture Start      e.g. 2,8
5. Apeture End        e.g. 4
6. Filtersize         Millimeter
7. Magnification      e.g. 0.11x
8. Magnification      e.g. 0,11
9. Magnification      e.g. 1:4
10. Mount	      e.g. Nikon F
11. Sensor	      e.g. Full-Frame / Crop
12. Weight            Gramm
13. Size              Diagramm x Length 



## Task List
- [ ] \(Must-Have)    Create UML graphs and keep them updated
- [ ] \(Must-Have)    Complete README file
- [ ] \(Must-Have)    Got all necessary data from the most Nikon F compatible lenses
- [ ] \(Must-Have)    Made a nice GUI for filtering and comparing the lenses (perhaps something like on "geizhals.de") 
- [ ] \(Should-Have)  Got all necessary data from all the Nikon F compatible lenses
- [ ] \(Should-Have)  Data of Autofocus (AF,AF-S,MF) and Vibration Reduction
- [ ] \(NiceTo-Have)  Move from Excel to a real database (e.g. Wide-Column?)
- [ ] \(NiceTo-Have)  Complete standalone program.
- [ ] \(NiceTo-Have)  Not only Nikon F lenses, but all Lenses compatible to Nikon F (e.g. with adapter the Pentax Lenses)
- [ ] \(SuperNiceTo-Have)  Not only NIkon F and Nikon F lenses, but all Lenses every made.

## Motivation
I really enjoy comparing all the lenses out there.
But on "geizhals.de" you just can compare all lenses which are in stock at the moment.
So all of the good old glas and perhaps one or the other pearl is missing in that list.
I didn't find such a list, so here I will build my own. 

Also I want to practice how to document a project well so everybody could understand it.

###### Example Readme:
Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

Installation
Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

Contributors
Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
